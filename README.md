## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I’ve learned that I’m getting better at working with JavaScript, especially when it comes to adding validation. Implementing a warning to ensure a rating is provided before submitting the form helped me improve my understanding of conditionals and event handling in JS.

### Continued development

My goal remains the same: to learn how to create perfectly mobile-adapted websites. I'm dedicated to mastering this skill.

### Useful resources

- [A (more) Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - Thanks again to Andy Bell for his wonderful cheat sheet! I'm using it, adapting it to my needs, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
